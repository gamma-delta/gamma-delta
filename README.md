Hello! I'm Petra. I'm a self-taught programmer, game designer, and small-time author and musician.

`petrak@` is pronounced "petra-kat."

## Interests

- Video games: Ultrakill, Noita, Exapunks, MOLEK-SYNTEZ, Fez, Celeste
- Books: Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, Ursula K. Le Guin's works, The Mysterious Benedict Society
- Music: TWRP, she, Meganeko, Maynard Ferguson, Snarky Puppy
- Academia: psychology, microcomputing, recreational mathematics, linguistics

I have a lot of strange interests that don't seem to go together very well.

## Other Things I Make

- Electronic music
- Short stories
- Pixel art

I haven't published much of these... I often feel like my art isn't very good.

## Hire Me!

Hi! I'm a broke college student who's always been passionate about being able to afford food, and I'm looking for freelance work.

I can write you a Minecraft mod or a small game, or write you a short story or some music if you like. Or something else perhaps. Just email or message me, and we can discuss rates.
